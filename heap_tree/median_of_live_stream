# Problem Statement
# Given an input stream of n integers the task is to insert integers to 
# stream and print the median of the new stream formed by each insertion of x to the stream.

# The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the no of elements of the stream.
# Then the next N lines contains integer x denoting the no to be inserted to the stream.
